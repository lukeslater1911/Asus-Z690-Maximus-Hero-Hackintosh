Copy EFI folder to install USB, change SMBIOS to iMacPro1,1, generate your serials etc

Additional info will follow within the nextr few days


Modified EFI folder. Add your serial number, board serial, ROM etc.
I disabled Intel WiFi/BT because it caused random crashes.
OpenCore version is still 0.86 because system hangs at boot with OC 0.88
